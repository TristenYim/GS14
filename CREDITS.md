## Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach 
(*Written by Stuart Reges from University of Washington and Marty Stepp from Stanford University*)

While I've taken this project well beyond the suggested solution in the textbook, it was this textbook that put this unique spin on the Levenshtein distance algorithm in the first place. Without this textbook, this project would not have existed. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.buildingjavaprograms.com).

## Dictionaries

**[Dywl's List of English Words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)**

This is used in the original [JavaWithMiyoshi repository](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/JavaWithMiyoshi). Here is the specific commit of [words_alpha.txt](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/71fd8028395eb61be17e47f70dde0ae6994d9b72/words_alpha.txt) that was used to generate [Dictionary370k.txt](./resources/Dictionary370k.txt).

**[John M. Lawler's Wordlist](https://websites.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html)**

This was used to generate [Dictionary70k.txt](./resources/Dictionary70k.txt).

**Eric Price's Wordlists**

Price made a [10k wordlist](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000), which was used to generate [Dictionary10k.txt](./resources/Dictionary10k.txt), and a [100k wordlist](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.100000) which hasn't been too useful for me but may be helpful for others.
