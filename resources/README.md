# Dictionaries

[Dictionary 370k.txt](./Dictionary370k.txt) was taken directly from [JavaWithMiyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/JavaWithMiyoshi). [Dictionary 70k.txt](./Dictionary70k.txt) and [Dictionary10k.txt](./Dictionary10k.txt) have both been modified to be sorted in the correct order and have special characters and slurs removed. Note that the exact length of dictionary may not be reflected by the name, as is the case for [Dictionary70k.txt](./Dictionary70k.txt) which only has 67.5k words (I named it this because its a cleaner number and the original dictionary had nearly 70k words). NOTE: While the code to do this is not yet merged into this repository, I plan to do that eventually. If this note is still here and I've merged the code, that's because I probably forgot to remove this note.
