# About

This project was originally a school assignment. With the encouragement of my teacher's TA, I've since optimized it far beyond what anybody else had done. This version of this project also contains other assignments from Goal Sheet 14 and remnants of IntelliJ, which I've since switched away from in favor of NeoVim. I leave this version tagged in case anyone's interested in what I came up with as a student, for this is the final version I wrote while taking AP Computer Science A.
